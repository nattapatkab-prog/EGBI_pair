BMW Car Dataset: An Exploratory Analysis of Vehicle Characteristics Introduction
The BMW Car Dataset provides detailed information on different BMW models, including specifications such as transmission type, fuel type, mileage, engine size, and price. The main objective of this analysis is to explore relationships between these factors and identify trends that can help understand which features most influence car pricing and market distribution. By analyzing this dataset, we can gain valuable insights into the automotive market and consumer preferences for different BMW models.
Dataset Overview
The dataset contains information about various BMW car models and their attributes. Key features include:
• Model: The name of the BMW model (e.g., X5).
• Year: Year of manufacture.
• Price: Price of the car in pounds (£).
• Transmission: Type of gearbox (Automatic, Manual, Semi-Auto). • Mileage: The total distance the car has traveled.
• Fuel Type: Type of fuel used (Petrol, Diesel, Hybrid, Electric, Other). • Tax: Vehicle tax rate.
• MPG: Miles per gallon fuel efficiency.
• Engine Size: Size of the engine in liters.
Data processing
1. Data Loading: The BMW Car Dataset was downloaded from Kaggle for analysis. It was imported into a Python environment to prepare for data exploration.
2. Data Inspection: The dataset was inspected to check data types, missing values, and overall structure to ensure data quality and readiness for analysis.
3. Data Cleaning: Missing or incorrect values were handled, and unnecessary columns were removed. All variables were standardized to ensure consistency before visualization.
4. Data Visualization: Using Matplotlib and Seaborn, various plots such as pie charts, bar charts, and count plots were created to visualize the relationships between categorical and numerical variables.

## Graphs Result and Discussing

Transmission Type: Semi-Automatic cars were the most common among BMW models, showing drivers prefer convenience and
modern technology.

Fuel Type: Petrol cars remained the most dominant, while Diesel use decreased. Electric and Hybrid models appeared more in recent years.

Car Model and Price: Luxury models such as X7 and 8 Series had higher prices, while 1 Series and 3 Series were more affordable options.

## Conclusion

The analysis of the BMW Car Dataset shows clear patterns in the company’s car models. Semi-Automatic transmissions are the most popular, and petrol remains the main fuel type, though electric and hybrid models are becoming more common. Luxury models like the X7 and 8 Series are priced much higher than entry-level ones like the 1 and 3 Series. Overall, the data reflects BMW’s wide range of cars designed to fit different customer needs and market trends.
